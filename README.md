About me:

Coding fascinates me.

I always thought my life was going to go down a different road. As a kid I enjoyed drawing and computers very much, and maths and physics were fascinating me, so when my time came to choose university I thought Graphic Design would be the perfect combination between drawing and computers and that is why I decided to study Arts, as Graphic Design was not available in my university back then.

With the years and hand-on experience I learnt that I was actually much more interested in the computers, so I tried to move on into IT related jobs but the lack of formal education did not help. Was here when I first started exploring the idea about learning how to code. Best decission of my life.

Right now I am still learning and in the road to my dream job, but first steps have been made. Right now my specialities include:
-Html.
-Css.
-Javascript.
Also have a medium/in-depth knowledge about design concepts (Typography, composition, colors, styles, etc) and a medium level of Photoshop.
